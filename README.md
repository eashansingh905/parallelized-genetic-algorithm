# parallelized-genetic-algorithm

Non-convex optimization problems tackle an area of mathematics with many real-world applications in fields like signal processing, machine learning, and control systems. Due to the presence of many local optima, these problems become difficult to solve. 
One class of techniques used to solve constrained and unconstrained optimization problems are *genetic algorithms*. Genetic Algorithms (GA) model phenomena observed in biology and metaheuristic techniques by generating better and better “candidate solutions” that aspire towards stronger fitness function values. The generation of these candidate solutions can take time and their scalability is limited due to computation on single processors and high computational load.

This project aims to build a parallelized genetic algorithm (DGA) for solving a non-convex optimization problem, specifically the Rastrigin function.
